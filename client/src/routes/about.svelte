    Ferret is an opinionated Question and Answer forum. The lack of downvotes
    and upvotes are a conscious design choice which let the prose of the
    questions and answers speak for their opinion without being brigaded by
    others who do not aggree

    Discussions are to remain civil and formal. If a user is midbehaving, please
    report them and an admin will look into their post or comment for rude
    behaviour. If a reply to your post is misleading it is preferrable to reply
    to it explaining why, rather than leaving another anonymous downvote.
